## Personalizing user activation with machine learning and multivariate testing

Identifying the different ways in which users use a product can be useful on several levels. In this project we will look at how identifying user classes allows for simple personalization of the product, and to what extent simple personalized treatments can alter user behavior.

It is often the case that some identified user classes are more desirable than others. Either because its associated users generate more revenue, use the product more, invite their friends, or similar. This project describes a system capable of not only identifying user classes, but more importantly a framework for identifying the most effective ways of driving users toward more desirable user classes.

More specifically, given a set of identified user classes and a set of predefined treatments, we want to find out how each treatment affects each user class. Although the project implementation will specifically target the video conferencing service appear.in, a major research question will be to what extent the results generalize.
