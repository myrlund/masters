User adaptation in an anonymous application setting
-----------------------------

The goal of the project in this thesis is to explore the viability of an approach to user adaptation where the application context is significantly more constraining than in most cases seen in previous academic work.

The project describes and implements a system for rolling out product features incrementally in an optimal way, based on feature adoption statistics within user segments. In other words, the described system allows for simple personalization of the product while experimenting with different feature variations.

We find that there are indeed clear differences in feature adoption across the identified user segments. However, limitations due to the lack of stable user identity make the approach unfeasable in practice.
