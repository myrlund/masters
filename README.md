User adaptation in an anonymous application setting
-----------------------------

The goal of the project in this thesis is to explore the viability of a new approach to user adaptation, where the requirements of the application are significantly more constraining than in most cases seen in previous academic work.

In this project we will describe a system for rolling out product features incrementally in an optimal way, based on feature adoption statistics within user segments. In other words, the described system allows for simple personalization of the product while experimenting with different feature variations.

Identifying the different ways in which users use a product can be useful on several levels, and it is often the case that some are more desirable than others. This can be due to its associated users generating more revenue, using the product more, inviting their friends, or similar. This project describes a system capable of not only identifying user classes based on user behavior, but more importantly: a framework for identifying the most effective ways of adapting the product to these user class segments, in effect driving users in a desirable direction.

More specifically, given a set of identified user classes and a set of predefined treatments, we want to find out how each treatment affects each user class. Although the project implementation will specifically target the video conferencing service appear.in, a major research question will be to what extent the results generalize.

We find that there are indeed clear differences in feature adoption across the identified user segments. However, due to uncertainty caused by domain constraints, it is uncertain to what extent the results generalize.
