User adaptation in an anonymous application setting
-----------------------------

The goal of the project in this thesis is to explore the viability of an approach to user adaptation where the application context is significantly more constraining than in most cases seen in previous academic work.

In this project I describe a system for rolling out product features incrementally in an optimal way, based on feature adoption statistics within user segments. In other words, the described system allows for simple personalization of the product while experimenting with different feature variations.

Identifying how different classes of users use an application differently can be useful on several levels, and it is often the case that some are more desirable than others. This can be due to its associated users generating more revenue, using the product more, inviting their friends, or similar. This project describes a system capable of not only identifying user classes based on user behavior, but more importantly: a framework for identifying the most effective ways of adapting the product to these user class segments, in effect driving users in a desirable direction.

We find that there are indeed clear differences in feature adoption across the identified user segments. However, due to uncertainty caused by domain constraints, it is uncertain to what extent the results generalize.
