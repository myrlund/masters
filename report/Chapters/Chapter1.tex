\section{Background and motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

My motivation for doing a user adaptation project related to anonymous online video conferencing is comprised of two important factors. To understand how they are related and why they both are of equally big interest, some background on both the technological landscape of the web and the application case is needed.

For a long time, developing video conferencing services was an extremely challenging discipline, and as a result the market has consisted of a correspondingly low number of actors. However, this trend is currently in the process of being shaken and turned on its head with the introduction of HTML5; more specifically, with the introduction of the WebRTC\footnote{Web Real-Time Communication.} specification.

As the name implies, WebRTC handles real-time communication, but for our case, the important aspect of the technology is that it is able to do so peer-to-peer. Although it per design is a protocol for exchanging arbitrary data between peers, it is particularly geared toward multimedia streams. For instance, the traditionally cumbersome task of setting up a two-way audiovisual connection is now a matter of dropping around 40 lines of boilerplate Javascript into a web page\footnote{For an excellent introduction, see: \url{http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/basics/}.}.

Although the WebRTC specification is still officially a \emph{working draft} in the W3C\footnote{The latest specification can be found here: \url{http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/webrtc.html}.}, several large browser vendors have already implemented it, and applications previously unseen on the web pop up every week.

\subsection{Introducing appear.in}

One of these applications is called appear.in, and it will serve as the main use case in this thesis. Like many other WebRTC applications, appear.in concerns itself with video conferencing. The idea is simple enough: a conversation happens between users who are in the same room at the same time. The central idea, though, is that the room is identified solely by the URL in use, and not in any way by the peers connecting. As an example, if any two people are visiting \url{https://appear.in/ntnu} at the same time, they will see and hear each other and can start chatting away without any further call setup or configuration.

This view of a conversation as not really being an enitity in its own right, but rather an \emph{effect} of people being in the same room at the same time, breaks with the traditional model of audiovisual communication. Traditionally, talking to someone not present has been a process of one person \emph{calling} the other one, with group conversations usually being nothing more than an extension of this concept. appear.in doesn't concern itself with distinguishing between callers and callees, has no simple concept of a ``conversation'', and generally does not enforce any particular way of using the service -- apart from requiring the conversation venue to be identifiable by a string of characters.

\subsection{Usage patterns}

Until the arrival of WebRTC, this particular way of thinking about conversations for anything but textual conversations hasn't been a big thing. However, the simplicity of the room concept opens the service up for a wide variety of uses\footnote{In addition to traditional video calls, we've already seen it used for everything from virtual offices and team meeting rooms to baby monitoring and remote tutoring, just to name a few.}. These wildly varied use cases are where the motivation for this project stems from:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item If the users' behaviors are quantified, will any clear and distinct usage patterns emerge?
  \item If so, can the different uses be better served by dynamically adapting the product to fit each of them?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Anonymity and privacy}
\label{sub:anonymity_privacy}

appear.in is an anonymous communication service. No personal information is ever collected about the users, and not even IP-addresses or geolocational data is logged on an individual level. By tracking individual \emph{browsers} using cookies, then logging behavioral events along with a cookie identifier, we can measure user behavior over time.

This all opens a wide series of questions bordering to sociological aspects of web usage:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    To what extent can an anonymous web service be adapted?
    Is user behavior enough to provide a satisfactory personalized user experience?
  \item
    Will a personalized user experience go against the users' expectations of appear.in as an anonymous web service?
  \item
    How can we measure any of this?
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Absence of identity} % (fold)

Several others have written about how privacy constraints impact personalized systems~\cite{Teltzrow2004,Kobsa2007}. In many ways, the very nature of anonymity is an extension of privacy. However, the absence of \emph{identity} presents an entirely different challenge.

There are ways of coping with the absence of user identification. Kobsa, for instance, describes an approach that makes heavy use of pseudonyms designed around this problem~\cite{Kobsa2003}.
However, appear.in is not only a pseudonymous service -- it is a fully anonymous service; there are no user accounts, and there is no login.
Tracking users, then, is obviously a bit of a struggle.

\subsubsection{Tracking users}

appear.in runs in the browser. The first time a user enters the site, a cookie is set with a random value uniquely identifying the browser over time. This value is sent with every event to the instrumentation service used for user analytics.

Unfortunately, using only cookies for identification has its clear downsides. Should the user clear the browser cache, switch browsers, use the browser ``incognito''\footnote{Google lingo for private browsing, where previously set cookies are not available (among other things).}, or simply use multiple machines, then different user ids will be generated for each case.

Without tracking more user information -- IPs and locations, for instance -- there is no easy way of tying these user ids together\footnote{Some suggestions on how to solve this is found in the suggestions for further work, in section~\ref{sec:further_work}.}, and to reason about them as a single user. However, collecting this information about users goes against appear.in's privacy policy, and it has been deemed more interesting to see what can be done without crossing this line.

\subsection{Why personalize?} % (fold)
\label{sub:why_personalize}

\emph{@TODO: Write out in full-text.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Premise: Users use service in different ways, and want a simple UI targeted at their specific use case.
  \item Goal: Provide an interface which stimulates activation and retention.
  \item Result: Increase general user base, as well as their happiness (as measured by metrics such as recurring visits and time on site).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Visualization of clustering}

@TODO: What is the state of the art regarding visualization of spacio-temporal clusters. (Dimensionality reduction etc.)

Package into clustering tool to improve business intelligence. Challenges from lack of demographics.

\section{Problem specification}
\label{sec:problem_specification}

\textbf{Main research question:} Can users of anonymous video conferencing services be clearly divided into user classes based on their behavior, and if so, to what effect can personalization improve their activity level?

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Are users of video conferencing services such as appear.in clearly dividable into separate groups based only on their behavior within the service? Do these patterns reflect those seen elsewhere -- in other types of internet services or even in real life?
  \item Is it feasible to personalize treatments to these user classes? Does it stimulate users into becoming more active users?
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Is this something these users want?
    \item Do the inferred preferences of the detected user classes significantly differ from each other?
    \item Can the personalized treatments be devised in such a way as to stimulate the moving of users in the direction of any desired user class?
  \end{enumerate}
  \item How can a toolkit be devised to handle the following?
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item User classification based on behavior.
    \item Product personalization based on a relevant user's class.
    \item Tracking of each treatment's effect on each user class.
    \item Prioritize using the most effective treatments without introducing statistical bias (see multi-armed bandit).
    \item Allow product developers to easily access results to improve future feature prioritization.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Organization of the thesis}
