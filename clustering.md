Clustering
==========

Firstly, we need to quantify our users â€“ express them in terms of numbers, with as many relevant, orthogonal axes as possible.

Some possible dimensions:

1. Chat frequency
2. Chat duration (average or cumulative)
3. Chat count
4. Number of rooms owned
5. Number of rooms followed
6. Unique users talked to
7. Second-degree unique users talked to
